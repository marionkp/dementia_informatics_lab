Welcome to the Dementia Informatics lab based at the University of Cambridge. We seek to understand how dementia affects the whole brain, using a combination of brain imaging, pathology data, genetic? and cognitive testing.

We admit to some tendencies towards geekiness. As such, this website is entirely designed and written by members of the group.
